Week-7: Firebase
Overview

In this unit you will be introduced to the concept of saving, or persisting, user data.

There are two main types of storage we will use to save data:

Client Side Storage: uses cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage to save and reuse user data across a userâ€™s session.
Server Side Storage: saves user info to a database that can be reused across multiple devices and sessions. We'll use Firebase to accomplish this.
You'll also cover working with Date objects in JavaScript using the Moment.js library. Dates come up often in programming, whether you're building a scheduling application, todo-list, e-commerce app, etc. You'll also use the Moment.js library to do things such as converting between various date formats and finding the difference between two dates.
